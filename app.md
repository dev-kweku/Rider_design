Perfect 👏 — narrowing it down to **delivery riders only** is a *smart strategic move*.

It makes your platform **simpler to build**, **easier to market**, and **more focused** — so you can dominate one niche before expanding (like how Bolt started with rides before adding food).

Let’s reframe everything specifically for **delivery riders** 👇

---

## 🚴‍♂️ **PROJECT NAME (Working Title):**

**RiderLink GH** — “Find trusted delivery riders near you — fast, easy, and verified.”

---

## 🚨 **1. Problem Overview**

Across Ghana, businesses and individuals face major issues with deliveries:

* Hard to find **available, reliable riders** when needed.
* Many riders rely on **WhatsApp groups or word of mouth** to get jobs.
* Riders lack **visibility, steady customers, and job tracking tools.**

**Pain points:**

* Businesses waste time searching for riders.
* Riders lose potential income because they’re invisible online.
* No central place to **find, compare, and book** verified delivery riders.

---

## 💡 **2. Solution Summary**

A **delivery rider listing + booking platform** where:

* **Riders** can **register, verify, and list** their delivery services.
* **Customers** (restaurants, shops, individuals) can **search, view profiles, and contact riders** directly.
* **Payments and communication** handled via **Mobile Money** and **WhatsApp** for simplicity.

Think of it as:

> “Uber for delivery riders — without the complex dispatching system.”
